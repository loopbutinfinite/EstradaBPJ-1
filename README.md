// Description: Created a website with multiple pages utilizing custom classes and components that are being called from BootStrap's CSS library. 
// Peer Review Darcy Rose - I like your use of cards and dropdowns from the Bootstrap Library. The font is legible against the background, which is good. The dropdowns could benefit from some styling. I would love it if the color scheme were more cohesive and thematic but overall the functionality is spot on. Good job!
