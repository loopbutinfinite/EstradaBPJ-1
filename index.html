            <div class="col">
                <p><strong>Edgar Allan Poe</strong> (January 19, 1809 - October 7, 1849) born in Boston, and second
                    child to <u>David Poe</u> and <u>Elizabeth “Eliza” Poe</u>. Unfortunately, his father would abandon
                    the family in 1810, and shortly after, Edgar’s mother would pass away shortly after. Poe would later
                    be taken in by John and Francis Allan; despite not formally being adopted, Edgar Allan Poe would
                    live with them until his young adulthood. Despite his hardships, Edgar Allan Poe would become well
                    known as an American writer, poet, editor, and literary critic who is best known for his poetry and
                    short stories. His popularity rose to such fame that he is often credited and regarded as being one
                    of the central figures of Romanticism and Gothic fiction in the United States and of early American
                    literature. Poe’s work influenced the development of literature throughout the world and even
                    impacted such specialized fields as cosmology and cryptography. Even after his death, he and his
                    writings appear numerous times throughout many media types in a variety of fields such as art,
                    photography, literary allusions, music, and motion pictures. </p>
